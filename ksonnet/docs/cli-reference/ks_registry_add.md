## ks registry add

Add a registry to the current ksonnet app

### Synopsis


The `add` command allows custom registries to be added to your ksonnet app,
provided that their file structures follow the appropriate schema. *You can look
at the `incubator` repo (https://github.com/ksonnet/parts/tree/master/incubator)
as an example.*

A registry is given a string identifier, which must be unique within a ksonnet application.

There are three supported registry protocols: **github**, **fs**, and **Helm**.

GitHub registries expect a path in a GitHub repository, and filesystem based
registries expect a path on the local filesystem.

During creation, all registries must specify a unique name and URI where the
registry lives. GitHub registries can specify a commit, tag, or branch to follow as part of the URI.

Registries can be overridden with `--override`.  Overridden registries
are stored in `app.override.yaml` and can be safely ignored using your
SCM configuration.
